  The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is an independent agency within the
  federal government that oversees the behavior and ethics of executive branch
  employees. The OGE provides guidance and advice on ethics laws and regulations
  to government officials, conducts ethics training programs, and reviews
  financial disclosure reports to ensure compliance with ethical standards. The
  office also works to prevent conflicts of interest and promote transparency
  and accountability in government operations. By upholding ethical standards
  and promoting integrity in public service, the OGE plays a vital role in
  maintaining the trust and confidence of the American people in their
  government.
